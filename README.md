# Tombrog.github.io

Thomas Gorman, tbgorman@my.waketech.edu

My GitHub account's username is Tombrog, it is currently empty besides the one repository I was asked to create

The repository I created is blank save for this readme file

To get my files off of github I just logged in and selected the repository I wanted, and then hit "clone repository". Then I editied the readme file and (after making sure I logged the changes) clicked "Push" which uploaded the new files to GitHub
